* Font may be too small
* The following example is a little difficult to read:

```js
var nameElem = element.all(by.css('.details'))
                      .all(by.css('personal'))
                      .get(0);
```
* I would not recommend by name since you can use by css instead and you
  cannot copy paster 
* Use `prefer` instead of `favor`
* Add better example for PO functions
